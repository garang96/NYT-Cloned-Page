I did the floating and positioning elements project as directed by the Odin Project.

this was a project that provided me with lots of learning experiences. Right from using flex box ,grid, floats and the positoning offsets. I kinda had not really understood how to go about them. the project required me to cloned almost the exact page of a New York Times Article.
