# HTML & CSS : NYT Cloned Page

I did the floating and positioning elements project as directed by the Odin Project.

This is a project that provided me with lots of learning experiences. Right from using flex box ,grid, floats and the positoning offsets. I kinda had not really understood some of them but finally got it through this project. The project required me to clone an article page of the New York Times. It was an interesting and enjoyable project for practice.
